#      to ensure that all possible special characters, including backticks, are ignored. This commented out line will
#      end up as the most recent entry in the $MCFLY_HISTORY file.
#   2. Type "mcfly search" and then run the command. McFly will pull the last line from the $MCFLY_HISTORY file,
#      which should be the commented-out search from step #1. It will then remove that line from the history file and
#      render the search UI pre-filled with it.
